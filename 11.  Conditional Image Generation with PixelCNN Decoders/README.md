I trained an image generator using a slight variant of the pixelCNN architecture called Conditional Image Generation with PixelCNN Decoders.



I trained for 60 epochs for about 10 hrs.


I think the results are pretty okay. It is still somewhat obvious which ones are real and which ones are generated, but I believe if the epochs would be ramped up together with hyperparameter optimization, then you could get some really good results that could fool someone who doesn't know machine learning has been used to generate it.
