I used the LJSpeech dataset to generate a audio clip with Wavenet.

The training required some time and the results were best when preprocessing of Mel Spectrogram was involved.

For synthesiastion I used the following parameters: --n_block 8 --n_flow 6 --n_layer 2 --causal no --load_step 100000 --temp 0.7 --num_samples 10
