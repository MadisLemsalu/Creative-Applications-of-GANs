I used the the Magenta library to generate a music example.



I liked how Magneta can handle any monophonic midi file and as the documentation is good, itâ€™s relatively easy to set-up. Unfortunately the current development can only generate a single stream of notes. Hopefully in the future it is possible to combine the generated melodies with drums and guitars
